	/* Remote interface is present in java.rmi package. A remote object is an object
	 * which is stored at one machine and accessed from another machine. So, to make
	 * an object a remote object, we need to flag it with Remote interface. Here,
	 * Remote interface serves to identify interfaces whose methods may be invoked
	 * from a non-local virtual machine.Any object that is a remote object must
	 * directly or indirectly implement this interface. RMI (Remote Method
	 * Invocation) provides some convenience classes that remote object
	 * implementations can extend which facilitate remote object creation.
